# perl-exam-auto-assessment
- This is a small perl script for (semi-)automated assessment of a multiple choice exam in text format.
- This project is an assignment for the perl-course held by Dr. Damian Conway from Australia in summer 2020.
- See [IntroPerl_project_specification_2020.pdf](IntroPerl_project_specification_2020.pdf) 
for extended project description.

## Team
- Andreas AmbÃ¼hl - https://github.com/AndiSwiss

## (CPAN-)modules used
- We used the following (CPAN-)modules:
  - Data::Show
  - Exporter
  - Lingua::StopWords
  - List::Util
  - POSIX
  - Regexp::Grammars
  - Term::ANSIColor
  - Text::Levenshtein::Damerau
- We created custom modules -> in the folder `lib/Andiluca`. If you run the perl scripts from the project-root, then
these modules should be automatically detected: For example `perl src/main.pl` should work, after you installed all
required CPAN-Modules.


## Usage
- For creating empty tests (with randomized order of answers of each question), use the script `main.pl`:
  - If the user doesn't provide an argument, all the *.txt in the folder 'AssignmentDataFiles/MasterFiles/'
    are processed for this script: `perl src/main.pl`
  - The user can provide one or multiple files as parameter 
  - If you provide one argument, the script runs with the given file. Example: `perl src/main.pl AssignmentDataFiles/MasterFiles/short_exam_master_file.txt`
  - The generated empty tests will be created in a subfolder named `/Generated`, inside the directory of the provided file.
    Note: This subdirectory will be created if not already present.
- For generating the score of all the files, use the script `score.pl`:
  - First parameter: Master-file
  - Second parameter: Student-file(s)
  - example: `perl src/score.pl AssignmentDataFiles/MasterFiles/FHNW_entrance_exam_master_file_2017.txt AssignmentDataFiles/SampleResponses/*`



## Caveats

- There is one file which behaves very different on the computer of Luca (with Ubuntu) and my computer (macOS):
  - If we both run the command 
    `perl src/score.pl AssignmentDataFiles/MasterFiles/FHNW_entrance_exam_master_file_2017.txt AssignmentDataFiles/SampleResponses/20170828-092520-FHNW_entrance_exam-ID039411` (which compares the exam-file with id "ID039411" with the master-file), we get a different result, which we could not 
    find an explanation for.
  - The other 35 files in AssignmentDataFiles/SampleResponses seem to behave identically on both computers.
